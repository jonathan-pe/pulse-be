## Point Scoring System

#### Core Principles

1.  Reward-Based System: Points are only awarded for correct
    predictions. No points are deducted for incorrect predictions.
2.  Odds-Based Rewards: The points earned scale with the
    difficulty of the prediction:

    - Predicting underdogs with higher odds earns more points.
    - Predicting favorites earns fewer points but still rewards
      consistency.

3.  Daily Engagement: Users are encouraged to return daily
    through bonus opportunities.

#### Points Tiers

1.  Baseline Tier:

    - Unlimited Predictions: Users can make as many predictions as
      they want daily.
    - Points: A fixed, small number of points (e.g., 10 points)
      for each correct prediction.

2.  Bonus Tier:

    - Daily Cap: Up to 5 predictions per day earn bonus
      points.
    - Enhanced Rewards: Points scale with:

      - Odds Multipliers: Larger rewards for underdog predictions.
      - Streak Bonuses: Additional multipliers for maintaining correct prediction streaks.

3.  High Volume Tier:

    - Threshold Limit: After 100 daily predictions, additional
      predictions no longer earn points.

#### Additional Features

- Odds-Based Formula:

  - Underdog: (Baseline Points) \* (1 + odds/100){.c0} for
    positive odds.
  - Favorite: (Baseline Points) \* (1 - odds/100){.c0} for
    negative odds.

- Streak Bonuses:
  - Points multipliers increase with streaks of 2 or more correct
    predictions.
  - Streak resets after an incorrect prediction.

#### Anti-Abuse Measures

- Rate-Limiting: Limits on how frequently predictions can be
  made.
- Point Caps: Predictions beyond the high-volume threshold
  earn no points.
- Bot Detection: Behavioral monitoring flags potential
  abuse.
